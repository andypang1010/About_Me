                <p>I am a Freshman college student currently studying at Cornell University intending to major in Computer Science and minor in Physics.</p>
                <p>I was born in Shenzhen, one of the fastest growing cities in China. It is also very close to Hong Kong, only being half an hour worth of driving distance from the place I live in. </p>
                <p>I would say that I lived a pretty normal life: <ul><li>I went to a local elementary school (got 0 on almost all my English quizzes simply because I sucked at it)</li><p></p> <li>I was pretty socially awkward during my middle and high school years, but I still managed to make friends who I would trust my life with</li><p></p> <li>I went to a fantastic college (although some might disagree), and I have a beautiful girlfriend who I love so much...</li></ul></p>
                <p>I can go on for an entire day talking about myself here, but I think it would be better if left for what I will be showing you later on.</p>

                <h4><u>Why did I decide to make a website?</u></h4>
                <p>I was going through some of the old files on my laptop a few weeks ago when I came across some photos that I took ages ago. They look old, without a doubt, but they still mean something to me, something very special. I don't know if anyone else would feel the same way, but at least that's the way I see it. Those are precious memories that I wouldn't want to relinquish.</p>
                <p>It might be weird for some people to put all those dusty, old pictures on their website, but I disagree. In fact, those are actually the very moments that define who you are in the first place.</p>
