                <p>I'm a Freshman at Cornell University at the College of Arts and Sciences. I will be majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Physics.</p>
                <p>I was born in Hong Kong but I spent the majority of my childhood in Shenzhen, one of the largest cities in China and the headquarter of lots of tech firms you might be familiar with.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it's spending so much time there that has led me to grow an interest in technology, which eventually takes me to where I am today: A software developer.</p>
                <p>Other than studying in the courses provided at school, I take online courses on Udemy to diversify my skills and interests. I then use what I have learnd to build projects of my own, which you can find in the <a href = "projects.html" style="color: red;">Projects</a> page.</p>
